## Description

The Cron Job Project aims to run automated tasks (cron jobs) on an Express.js application using GitHub Actions. The implemented cron job tasks can be scheduled to run periodically according to the specified cron scheduling.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed on your computer.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the command `npm install` to install all project dependencies.

## Configuration

Before running the cron job, make sure to configure the cron scheduling according to your needs.

1. Open the `.github/workflows/cron-job.yml` file.
2. In the `schedule` section, adjust the cron scheduling to fit your requirements. For example, `'0 12 * * *'` will run the cron job every day at 12:00 PM.
3. Save the changes to the file.

## Usage

After following the installation and configuration steps, the cron job will be executed automatically according to the specified scheduling. The execution results of the cron job will be displayed in the execution log on the Actions tab in this GitHub repository.
